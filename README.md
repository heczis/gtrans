# gtrans

A python library and some example scripts (to be gradually added) for manipulating 3D printer gcode files using geometrical transformations.
The main goal was to enable graded infill structures using any slicing software.
The principle is based on the work of [WÃ¼thrich et al.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54334-1_10) who used gcode transformations for support-less printing.

`gtrans` uses the transformations to create infill structures with non-uniform density and anisotropy.
The definitions of the geometrical transformations may be either analytical or based on a finite-element mesh with prescribed displacements at nodes.

The typical usage is:

1. Prepare the final geometry of a part to be printed

2. Define the displacement field, most probably as a `vtk` file.
   The FE mesh may or may not agree with the geometry of the part.
   
3. Create an `stl` file that contains the geometry transformed by the displacement field.

4. Use any slicing software to create a `gcode` on the transformed geometry.

5. Use the `gtrans.py` script to transform this `gcode` back onto the undeformed geometry.

The code consists of the following:

* `gtrans.py` - main script for transforming a uniform `gcode`

* `gcode.py` - module for working with the `gcode` instructions

* `femfun.py` - module for representing the geometric transformations using piecewise linear finite-element functions

* `geo.py` - simple geometry-related tools

* `examples` - showcase of different ways of using the tool

## Requirements

Most of the code uses [numpy](https://www.numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org), [matplotlib](https://www.matplotlib.org), and [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio).
Some of the examples may use the [SfePy](https://www.sfepy.org) finite-element library.

## Roadmap

The following is planned to add/resolve in near future:

* Finish support of 3D elements (hexa, tetra)

* Add examples

* Add transformation of `stl` files for use with resin printers

* Fix the behavior of hexagonal and similar infill patterns, where some parts of the extrusion lines need to bond together.
  This might also change the way of dealing with perimeters.
